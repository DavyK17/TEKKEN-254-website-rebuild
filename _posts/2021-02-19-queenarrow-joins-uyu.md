American eSports organisation UYU have announced Sylvia Gathoni, better known in the community as [QueenArrow](/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4455946), as the newest member of their content team on their [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/UYU/status/1362814560751747074). The team is widely recognised in the fighting game community, with some of the world's top talent across multiple titles currently on their roster, including Tekken players LowHigh and Jeondding (South Korea), and YUYU (Japan).

QueenArrow, who primarily plays [Lars](/guides/character.html?view=lars), [Xiaoyu](/guides/character.html?view=xiaoyu), [Leo](/guides/character.html?view=leo) and [Asuka](/guides/character.html?view=asuka), became the first Kenyan Tekken player and the first female gamer in East Africa to be signed by an eSports team when she [joined XiT Woundz (now XiT Gaming)](/news/2018/05/14/queenarrow-xit-woundz) in 2018. She later left the team to join defunct British outfit Brutal Democracy Esports in 2019, before leaving the following year to focus on her studies.

QueenArrow's most recent outing in the TEKKEN 254 Circuit saw her [qualify for Top 8](https://smash.gg/tournament/savanna-fgc-2020-qualifier-2-tekken-254-circuit-rampage-series/event/tekken-254-circuit-season-4/overview) for the first time in the competition, and with well-established names on her new team, we can expect her to continue improving and pushing for better results on Savanna Fight Night and when the Circuit returns.

    <p>On behalf of everyone in the Kenyan Tekken community, TEKKEN 254 wishes QueenArrow the very best of luck with her new team. You can watch her UYU announcement video below.</p>
