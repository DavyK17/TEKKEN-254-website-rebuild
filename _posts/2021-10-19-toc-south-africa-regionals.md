The South Africa Regional Finals are set to feature three Kenyan representatives in what is promising to be a nail-biting event. [Finishing third and joint-fifth at the Online Masters](/news/2021/09/19/dvk-toc-south-africa), [DVK](/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4092983) and [Xstar](/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4183920) had already earned enough points to qualify, but the former went a step further with a win at [Get Washed: Dojo #2](https://smash.gg/tournament/get-washed-dojo-2/event/get-washed-dojo-2-1/brackets/1004279/1584418/) to cement his place at fourth overall with 175 points on the leaderboard.

[Frost](/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4644523), who had already earned points with a third-place finish at [DeltaWaveDash](https://smash.gg/tournament/deltawavedash-1/event/deltawavedash-tekken-7-ps4-ps5/brackets/975595/1544450) before being bundled out of the Online Masters in joint-ninth place thanks to Xstar, put in some extra work for more points with a win at [Get Washed: Dojo #1](https://smash.gg/tournament/get-washed-dojo-1/event/get-washed-dojo-1/brackets/1004235/1584355) and a second-place finish at [Get Washed: Dojo #3](https://smash.gg/tournament/get-washed-dojo-3/event/get-washed-dojo-3/brackets/1004394/1584574) to get himself to joint-fifth, level with Xstar and Zambian player Onyx at 70 points, on the leaderboard.

The Regional Finals are set to take place on 6 November 2021, with competitors fighting for their share of the overall US$ 6,000 prize pool. The tournament will begin with the top two players, Bigdaddymike and Callym Beukes of Mozambique and South Africa respectively, taking turns picking players for the other's pool.
