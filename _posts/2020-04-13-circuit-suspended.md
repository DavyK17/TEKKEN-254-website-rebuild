In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has rocked the entire globe for the last few months, Savanna FGC has decided to keep Season Four of the <a href="/circuit" target="_blank">TEKKEN 254 Circuit</a> and Season One of the <a href="/circuit" target="_blank">Rampage Series</a> suspended while we continue to monitor the situation as it develops.

A new date will also be set for Qualifier Three for both competitions, which was set to take place on 25 April 2020 after <a href="/news/2020/03/07/qualifier-three-postponed" target="_blank">being postponed from its original date</a> of 28 March 2020, following the 6 April government directive to restrict movement into and out of Nairobi City County for at least three weeks. We are aware that the directive would affect certain players in the community who travel from outside Nairobi to compete at our events, while staging the event on that date would otherwise have not been prudent with regards to maintaining the safety of all players, spectators and organisers in the current climate. Further changes to the 2020 schedule will be announced at a later date as we continue to find solutions that benefit all parties moving forward.

We hope everyone is doing their best to stay safe and curb the spread of the novel coronavirus by staying home and restricting travel only to essential trips (such as acquiring food, medicine and other essential supplies), as well as following all the relevant guidelines provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health.

We apologise for any inconvenience these developments may have caused to any existing and prospective players, and we look forward to receiving the local fighting game community at our events once again as soon as possible.
