<p>Following the recent return of Julia Chang and the introduction of guest character Negan from The Walking Dead as part of Season Pass 2 for <em>Tekken 7</em>, fans had even more to be excited about Tuesday as Bandai Namco Entertainment and Twitch <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190312005321/en/BANDAI-NAMCO-Entertainment-America-Twitch®-Officially-Announce" target="_blank">jointly announced the return of the Tekken World Tour (TWT) for 2019</a>. Big news included the introduction of two new event types, Master+ and Dojo events, with an overall prize pool of over $185,500 making it the tour's largest ever so far.</p>
<p>The biggest news, however, for African fans was the inclusion of <a href="https://twitter.com/CTSFGC" target="_blank">Cape Town Showdown</a>, which will be the first ever African stop on the Tekken World Tour and is sure to shed the spotlight on several hidden talents across South Africa and the continent. The event will take place on the weekend of 7–8 September, just over one month after the TEKKEN 254 Circuit Finals later this year.</p>
<p>The releases of additional characters and excitement from the Tekken World Tour over the past year has kept <em>Tekken 7</em> fresh since it dropped on 2 June 2017, a remarkable feat considering how previous titles on the series would have waned in popularity this far into its release. Cape Town Showdown will be a massive opportunity for players in the Kenyan Tekken community and the African Tekken scene as a whole to announce themselves to the world and further make the case for increased international involvement in the TWT, especially in Africa.</p>
<p>If you didn't catch it, you can watch the announcement stream in which you will find the TWT 2019 trailer as well as more information for this year from commentators Tasty Steve and MarkMan.</p>
