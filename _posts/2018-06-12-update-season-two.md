As many of you are aware, planning for Season Two is ongoing and has been even before the conclusion of Season One earlier this year. We the organisers were pleased with the support we got from the players and spectators who came to our tournaments and we are doing everything we can to make Season Two even better. 

Unfortunately, a number of logistical barriers have prevented (and continue to prevent) us from making official announcements regarding dates, venues and prize money. Sorting these out has taken much longer than we would've liked but we are working diligently to make all the necessary arrangements for us to finally start staging tournaments.

We are sorry for the long wait and hope you bear with us as we do our best to get everything ready for a successful Season Two full of intense competition.
