We are shocked and saddened to have learned of the sudden passing of Brian Barasa Wafula this past Sunday. As the co-founder of [NAICCON](https://www.naiccon.co.ke/) (Nairobi Comic Convention), Barasa was a figurehead of geek culture in Kenya and at the core of the convention's continued growth since its inception in 2014.

Barasa was also head of business at [Pro Series Gaming](https://www.psg.co.ke/), with whom we collaborated on the [Kenya vs South Africa team battle](/news/2018/07/16/kenya-vs-south-africa) in July 2018, the Nairobi vs Durban team battle in December 2018, and the Finals for [Season 3](/circuit/archive/tekken/season-3.html) of the [TEKKEN 254 Circuit](/circuit) in August 2019.

On behalf of the Kenyan fighting game community, Savanna FGC extends its heartfelt condolences to Barasa's family, friends, and colleagues at both NAICCON and Pro Series Gaming. As a key member of the esports fraternity in Kenya, he will be sorely missed.
