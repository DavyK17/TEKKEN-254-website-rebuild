Following its creation and first season last year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tekken Online Challenge (TOC) is set to return for its second season from 1 June 2021, with Bandai Namco Entertainment [announcing the news](https://twitter.com/BNEesports/status/1396073360233172996) on Saturday. The competition sees the introduction of the Dojo system previously used on the Tekken World Tour, with one Master event for each region and an overall prize pool of $100,000 also unveiled for the entire season.

The second season of the TOC will include 14 regions across the globe, with African countries set to participate for the first time; "West Africa" and "South Africa" are the listed regions for the continent, with Kenya listed in the latter alongside Uganda, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, Angola, Mozambique, Madagascar, Comoros, Seychelles, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, RÃ©union and Malawi.

Since the [suspension of the TEKKEN 254 Circuit](/news/2020/04/13/circuit-suspended) (now the Savanna Circuit) in March 2020, players within the Kenyan community have continued to compete online on [Savanna Fight Night](/fight-night) (which continues on 11 June 2021) alongside other local competitions. The second season of the Tekken Online Challenge presents the Kenyan community its first opportunity to get involved in official global Tekken competition since [Darktempest](/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=0749083) and [Mickey](/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=2907096) took part in the 2019 season of the Tekken World Tour, competing at Cape Town Showdown in South Africa and Rox n Roll Dubai in the United Arab Emirates respectively.
