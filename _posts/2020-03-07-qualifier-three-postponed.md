Qualifier Three of the <a href="/circuit" target="_blank">TEKKEN 254 Circuit</a> and the <a href="/circuit" target="_blank">Rampage Series</a> will be taking place on 25 April 2020 and not on 28 March 2020 as previously scheduled. This is in response to logistical challenges behind the scenes that will make it difficult to put on an enjoyable event for everyone involved, while the new date also allows the TEKKEN 254 Circuit to have one extra tournament included as a Dojo event on this year's Tekken World Tour.

Players wishing to take part in both leagues will now have more time to sign up for Qualifier Three, with the deadline for Qualifier Three set for the end of day on 23 April 2020. If you would like to know more, <a href="/circuit" target="_blank">click here</a> for more information.

We apologise for any inconvenience this development may have caused to any existing and prospective players.
