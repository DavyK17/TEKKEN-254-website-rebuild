American eSports team XiT Woundz announced today that they completed the signing of Sylvia Gathoni, better known in the community as [QueenArrow](/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4455946). The team, based in New Jersey, shared the news on their [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/XiT_WoundzGG).

QueenArrow, who primarily plays Asuka and Leo, was the only female player to compete in Season One of the TEKKEN 254 Circuit and set a huge milestone by becoming the first Kenyan Tekken player and the first female gamer in East Africa to be signed by an eSports team. In an article written on XiT Woundz' website, owner Cody Maxwell stated that the team hopes "that other Western esports entities follow suit and sign players from Kenya and elsewhere."

QueenArrow finished Season One of the TEKKEN 254 Circuit in 19th place and will be hoping to improve on that performance heading into Season Two, perhaps with help from the rest of her team's Tekken roster, which includes Canadian players Akudama, Blackboards and Foxfist, as well as Venezuelan up-and-comer Pepsiman. On behalf of everyone in the Kenyan Tekken community, TEKKEN 254 wishes QueenArrow the very best of luck with her new team.
