<p>Qualifier Six on 6 July saw three familiar faces finish ahead of the pack yet again: <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=2907096" target="_blank">AP | Mickey</a> continued his tournament winning streak as many expected, with <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4092983" target="_blank">DVK</a>—recently recruited by The Watchmen (WTCH) eSports team alongside <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=8665351" target="_blank">PR1EST</a>—beating <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4644523" target="_blank">MoM | Frost</a> to second place for the first time since Qualifier Two on 23 February. <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=1677506" target="_blank">RMP | Shoryuken</a> pulled out of the Circuit prior to the tournament for personal reasons, leaving 17th-placed <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=2447761" target="_blank">Proto-G</a> to take his place in the Season Three Finals once the overall rankings were finalised after the tournament.</p>

    <p>In the Challenger Division, <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=3351510" target="_blank">RMP | Komrad_Vadim</a> sealed a first-place finish overall with a second-place finish at Qualifier Six to end the season on 86 points, with the tournament winner <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=6358951" target="_blank">Collins Odhiambo</a> coming in second place overall for the season with 62 points. <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=9712294" target="_blank">Kafikan</a> and <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=1049759" target="_blank">T-Vets | Defiant</a>, who were both absent for Qualifier Six, rounded off the Top 4 with 62 points (fewer set wins than Collins Odhiambo) and 57 points, respectively.</p>
    <p>Prior to the tournament, Circuit organisers consulted with players on the competition format. Following the discussions, it was decided that the Premier and Challenger Divisions will be unified from Season Four onwards, meaning that this season's Premier Division Playoffs no longer need to take place. However, the Challenger Division's Top 4 players this season shall still receive rewards (yet to be determined; details to be provided at a later date) for their efforts this season.</p>

    <h2 class="site-red uppercase">Circuit Finals</h2>
    {% include post-img.html src="2.jpg" caption="Second-placed MoM | Frost (left) and third-placed WTCH | DVK have faced each other 12 times on the Circuit thus far and could meet again this weekend as early as the Winners' Quarter-Finals" %}
    <p>The draw for the Circuit Finals set the stage for what are sure to be interesting battles in the Round of 16. Most notably, <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4183920" target="_blank">Xstar</a> and WTCH | PR1EST will be having a rematch of their Losers' Final meeting from the Season Two Finals on 1 September 2018, a set which the latter narrowly won 3-2 to advance to the Grand Final. The two have previously faced each other four times on the Circuit, with the series tied at 2-2.</p>
    <p>Elsewhere in the top half of the bracket, WTCH | DVK begins his campaign against <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=9894033" target="_blank">RobbyM$</a>, who will be making his first TEKKEN 254 Circuit Finals appearance. MoM | Frost will play his first set against <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=9970940" target="_blank">T-Vets | Nick Fury</a>, who will be looking to improve on his joint-13th place finish at the Season Two Finals, while <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=0749083" target="_blank">SU | Darktempest</a> sets off his run with a battle against <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4291033" target="_blank">T-Vets | Poker Face</a>. Should DVK and Frost win their sets, they would be set for a rematch of their Losers' Round 4 meeting last year, which the former won 2-0 to move on to the Losers' Semi-Final.</p>
    <p>In the bottom half of the bracket, AP | Mickey is set to kick off his title defence against <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=7167649" target="_blank">Lord Vega</a>, the first meeting between the two since Qualifier One on 26 January. <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=2685183" target="_blank">Tony</a> will be looking to better his joint-9th placing at the Season Two Finals starting with his first set against <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=1998890" target="_blank">Stanley Styler</a>, as <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=0145831" target="_blank">T-Vets | Battousai</a> rides on his positive form going into his set against <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=7900514" target="_blank">In4red</a>. The last set of the round will see <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=3798058" target="_blank">Furious Monkey</a>, another in-form player, duke it out in what should be an interesting set against <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=2447761" target="_blank">Proto-G</a>.</p>
