<p>Thousands of viewers were present once again as TEKKEN 254 founder Davy Kamanzi, better known as <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4092983" target="_blank">DVK</a>, finished third place in the South Africa Regional Finals of the Tekken Online Challenge (TOC), matching <a href="/news/2021/09/19/dvk-toc-south-africa" target="_blank">his run from the Online Masters</a> over two months prior. To earn that placing, he first had to participate in the elimination of his compatriots <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4644523" target="_blank">Frost</a> and <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4183920" target="_blank">Xstar</a>, who finished the tournament in joint-fifth and joint-seventh place, respectively.</p>

    <p>On 5 November 2021, Mozambique's Bigdaddymike and South Africa's Callym Beukes engaged in the Pools Selection process for the Regional Finals as the top two seeded players. The process curiously ended with Beukes pitting Bigdaddymike against all three Kenyans in Pool A, while having to face all his fellow South Africans and Zambia's Onyx in Pool B.</p>

    <p>The Regional Finals began with Frost taking a convincing 2-0 over Xstar, while DVK stumbled to a narrow 2-1 loss against Bigdaddymike. Frost then faced Bigdaddymike and produced one of the rounds of the tournament with an impressive comeback playing Negan against Bryan, but ultimately suffered the same fate as DVK by succumbing to a 2-1 defeat.</p>

    <p>Pool A continued with DVK clinching a 2-0 win over Xstar, effectively knocking him out of the tournament. Therefore, the following set between DVK and Frost would decide who advances to the final stage and was expected to be close given their history, but DVK pulled out a rather dominant performance to win 2-0 and bundle Frost out of the tournament in the process. The surprises didn't end there though, as Xstar pulled off the upset of the tournament by coming back from 1-0 down to beat Bigdaddymike 2-1 in a very close set.</p>

    <p>Xstar's win would prove crucial in deciding the outcome of Pool A; with both DVK and Bigdaddymike now tied at 2-1 in Pool A, the former advanced to the final stage in first place with a points difference of 3 (2-0, 2-0, 1-2), while the latter finished second with a points difference of 1 (2-1, 2-1, 1-2).</p>
