<p>Darktempest first joined the TEKKEN 254 Circuit for Round Two of Season One in February 2018, finishing third in his round-robin pool and thus missing out on Top 8. He has since rapidly risen to become one of the Kenyan community's most formidable players, most recently qualifying for the Circuit's Season Three Finals in sixth place and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzKbuZqHaN6/" target="_blank">being picked up by local esports team Simba Ultimate</a> in the process. He put in one of his best tournament performances to date at the Finals, held at The Junction Mall on 3 August, coming in second amongst the Circuit's top 16 players throughout the year.</p>
<p>Everyone in the Kenyan Tekken community and larger FGC will be cheering Darktempest on as he tests himself against foreign competition offline for the first time. Cape Town Showdown 7 will be streamed live on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/southafricanfgc" target="_blank">South African FGC Twitch channel</a> from 12 to 9 pm SAST (1 to 10 pm EAT) on Saturday and from 1 to 8 pm SAST (2 to 9 pm EAT) on Sunday.
