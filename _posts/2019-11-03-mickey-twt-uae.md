<p>Three-time (and reigning) TEKKEN 254 Circuit champion <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=2907096" target="_blank">AP | Mickey</a> is gearing up for a trip to the United Arab Emirates, where he is set to compete at Rox n Roll Dubai, a Tekken World Tour (TWT) Master event taking place on 8‚Äì9 November.</p>
<p>The tournament represents the Kenyan Tekken community's biggest test on an international stage thus far as it is set to feature some of the world's best Tekken players, including reigning Evo and Evo Japan champion Arslan Ash, Korean veteran Knee, and two-time French TWT finalist Super Akouma.</p>
<p>Mickey will be the second Kenyan player to take part in a Tekken World Tour event this year after <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=0749083" target="_blank">SU | Darktempest</a>, who put together a positive run at Cape Town Showdown in September to finish in third place out of 131 participants.</p>

<p>Not only has Mickey been a regular at TEKKEN 254 events since our first tournament in November 2017; he has won all 16 of them so far. His exploits were quickly noticed after Season One of the TEKKEN 254 Circuit by local esports team <a href="https://twitter.com/AlphaPlayke" target="_blank">AlphaPlay</a>, who picked him up alongside <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=8665351" target="_blank">PR1EST</a> and <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=2685183" target="_blank">Tony</a> (both of whom have since left the team) in May 2018.</p>
<p>Despite the competition around him becoming noticeably stronger over time, Mickey has managed to keep himself at the top; he most recently won his third Circuit title at the Finals held at The Junction Mall on 3 August, having dominated the qualifiers throughout the year.</p>
<p>The second day of Rox n Roll Dubai will coincide with the Savanna FGC launch event, which will take place at BulBul by Cheza in The Waterfront Mall, Nairobi from 11 am to 7 pm. The tournament will be shown live at the venue as the community throws its support behind Mickey during this event, and enjoys some world-class Tekken action alongside the Kenyan talent on display on the day.
