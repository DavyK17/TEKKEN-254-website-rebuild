<h1 class="page-title uppercase">Basic Attack and Defence in Tekken</h1>
<p>As with any fighting game, a player must attack their opponent to win in Tekken. However, a player must also defend to avoid taking damage. Players must therefore pick their moments and know when to attack and when not to attack, employing various strategies
    (or "strats") in the process to defeat the opponent.</p>
<p>In Tekken, four notations are assigned to each limb: <strong>1</strong> is left punch, <strong>2</strong> is right punch, <strong>3</strong> is left kick, and <strong>4</strong> is right kick. Other notations, such as "+" (at the same time as) or "," (then)
    are used to show how moves are executed (e.g. 1+2 is left punch and right punch at the same time; 3, 4 is left kick then right kick). See our notation chart for a full guide on move notations.</p>
<p>Attacks can be blocked with a <strong>standing guard</strong> (hold <span aria-label="back">b</span>) or a <strong>crouching guard</strong> (hold <span aria-label="down">d</span> or <span aria-label="down-back">d/b</span>), depending on the level of the hit.</p>
