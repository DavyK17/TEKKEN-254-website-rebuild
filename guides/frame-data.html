    title: Frame Data
    description: Get started on learning how to interpret frame data and apply it when playing Tekken.

<h2 class="page-title uppercase" id="introduction">Introduction to Frame Data</h2>
<p>Frames are a measure of time. Most fighting games in recent years, including <em>Tekken 7</em>, run at 60 frames per second. Frame data tells us the speed of moves in the game in various aspects: <strong>how long they take to hit the opponent</strong>,
    <strong>how much of an advantage/disadvantageâ€‹ the player gets</strong> after the move successfully connects/is blocked and much more.</p>
<p>When two players in a match are both moving around without using any attacks, they are in <strong>neutral frames</strong>, meaning neither player is at a frame advantage or disadvantage. When a move is used, the attacker will then be at <strong>neutral frames (0)</strong>,
    <strong>plus (+) frames</strong> (frame advantage) or <strong>minus (-) frames</strong> (frame disadvantage) depending on the move's properties.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This guide was created during Season 1 of <em>Tekken 7</em>, so some frame data on this page may be outdated. However, info on <strong>general punishment guidelines</strong> has been updated for Season 4.</p>

        <h2 class="page-title">Frame advantage</h2>
        <p>Every move in Tekken gives the player or their opponent frame advantage <strong>on block</strong>, <strong>on hit</strong> and <strong>on counter hit</strong> (hitting the opponent while they are also attacking). Frame advantage can be broken
            down into three forms: <strong>plus frames</strong>, <strong>neutral frames</strong> or <strong>minus frames</strong>.</p>
        <p>A move that is <strong>plus on block</strong> means that after the move is blocked, the attacker will be at a frame advantage, meaning that any follow-up attacks will come out before the opponent's. Conversely, a move that is <strong>minus on block</strong>            means that the opponent's follow-ups before the attacker's, while a move that is <strong>neutral (or 0) on block</strong> means the attacker and opponent's follow-ups will come out at the same time. The same principles, further explained below,
            apply to moves on hit and on counter hit. </p>
        <p>Before illustrating these situations, it is worth knowing that in most cases, a character's fastest move is <strong>10 frames (i10)</strong>, meaning the move takes 10 frames (or one sixth of a second) to connect with the opponent. In
            <em>Tekken 7</em>, the exceptions to this rule are <a href="./character.html?view=master-raven">Master Raven</a> and <a href="./character.html?view=xiaoyu">Ling Xiaoyu</a>, whose fastest moves are i8, as well as <a href="./character.html?view=geese">Geese</a>            (i9) and
            <a href="./character.html?view=yoshimitsu">Yoshimitsu</a> (i6).</p>
        <p>To illustrate plus, minus and neutral frames on block, we will use the three attacks below from <a href="./character.html?view=heihachi">Heihachi Mishima</a>'s move list against his wife <a href="./character.html?view=kazumi">Kazumi</a>.</p>

                <p>Being plus does not guarantee that your follow-ups will connect before your opponent's, and being minus does not guarantee that your opponent's follow-ups will connect before yours. While your moves will come out sooner in plus frames and
                    later in minus frames, the <strong>start-up</strong> (speed) of the moves ultimately determines who will get hit (if both you and your opponent attack).</p>

        <h2 class="page-title">Block punishment</h2>
        <p>Earlier, we pointed out that for most characters, their fastest move is i10 (usually jabs and jab strings). This means that in most cases, a move that is <strong>-10 or less on block</strong> is <strong>unsafe</strong>, while a move that is
            <strong>-9 or more on block</strong> is <strong>safe</strong> (keep the aforementioned exceptions in the <a href="#frame-advantage">frame advantage</a> section in mind as you continue to play the game).</p>
        <p>All characters have moves that act as <strong>punishers</strong> at different frames on block; punishers that are <strong>i12 or slower</strong> generally <strong>deal a good chunk of damage</strong>, while most <strong>i15 and i16 punishers</strong>            are usually <strong>launchers</strong> that can be followed up with a combo.</p>
        <p>All characters also have <strong>while standing (WS)</strong> and <strong>full crouch (FC) punishers</strong> to punish low attacks. Most lows are punishable by <strong>i11 WS/FC punishers</strong>, while <strong>stagger lows</strong> are always
            <strong>launch punishable</strong> (WS/FC launchers vary in speed between characters, but generally come out at i14 to i18). Be sure to note the advantages and disadvantages of each character's punishers as you continue to play the game; some
            have better punishment than others, both at different frames and in general.</p>
        <p>We will use <a href="./character.html?view=leo">Leo Kliesen</a> and <a href="./character.html?view=lili">Lili De Rochefort</a> to illustrate these various situations.</p>

        <p>In Tekken, there are multiple characters each with a vast number of moves, each one with their own unique properties, so one must be patient and inquisitive in learning how to deal with each individual character. However, there are certain general
            situations one will come across that can be dealt with in the same way, regardless of the opposing character. It is useful to familiarise yourself with these as you expand your knowledge on each character's frame data.</p>
        <div class="row gif-info">
            <ul class="col-12">
                <li><strong>Most lows in the game are -11 or less on block</strong>. Be sure to learn your character's i11 WS punish at the very least (WS 4 for most characters) and get that extra bit of damage whenever you block a low.</li>
                <li class="desktop-tip">In the example to the right, <a href="./character.html?view=master-raven">Master Raven</a> uses her WS 4 to punish <a href="./character.html?view=paul">Paul</a>'s SS 3. However, that low is -13 on block; are there any other punishers she

                    rage arts (all of which are i20, with <a href="#rage-arts">some exceptions</a>).</li>

        <p>If you would like to check out the frame data for a particular character, the feature was made available in-game as paid downloadable content for Season 3 of <em>Tekken 7</em>. However, if you'd prefer to look up frame data externally for free,
            we recommend visiting
            <strong><a href="https://www.rbnorway.org/">RBNorway.org</a></strong>, which has frame data for every character in <em>Tekken 7</em> and <em>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</em>. If you'd like frame data on your phone, there are a number of apps available
            for Android and iOS: try looking up "tekken 7 frame data" on your favourite app store.
