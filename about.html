    <h1 class="page-title uppercase">The Beginning</h1>
        <p>TEKKEN 254 (pronounced "tekken two five four") is a casual community venture seeking to grow the Tekken community in Kenya. Founded on 20 August 2017 by <strong>Davy Kamanzi</strong>,
            it was initially started as a Facebook group to gather fellow Tekken fans and share knowledge and ideas on the game, including through a weekly tutorial series entitled <em>Defensive Tuesdays</em>.</p>

        <p>In October 2017, TEKKEN 254 began a partnership with <strong>Ace Pro Gaming</strong> (now <strong>Ace Pro Sports Technologies Limited</strong>), an esports management firm equally as enthusiastic about growing the gaming scene in Kenya. On 4 November 2017,
            the two joined forces to hold TEKKEN 254's first tournament at the Tric Gaming Caf√© on Moi Avenue with a total prize pool of Ksh. 20,000, attracting 46 registrations and ultimately 24 confirmed participants.</p>
        <p>Played in the double-elimination format, players were split into two pools of 12, with 4 players advancing to the top 8 from each pool: 2 in the winners' bracket and 2 in the losers' bracket. After hours of intense competition,
            <strong>Mickey</strong> emerged the winner, taking the Ksh. 10,000 first prize after finishing the tournament unbeaten on sets and having suffered only one match loss, which came in the Grand Final against
            runner-up
            <strong>Tiz</strong> who went home with Ksh. 7,000.</p>
        <p>Davy finished third but, having taken part in the organisation of the tournament, decided to make himself ineligible for any prize money. The Ksh. 3,000 third prize was forfeited to fourth-placed <strong>Shoryuken</strong>,
            who lost to Davy in the Winners' Semi-Final and later to Tiz in the Losers' Semi-Final after beating <strong>Dice1533</strong> in Losers' Round 2.</p>
        <p>Following the November tournament, community members took part in the <em>Tekken 7</em> tournament at MJX (the Movie Jabber Expo) on 19 November 2017 and a casual bragging rights tournament on 2 December 2017, the results of which were used
            to seed players for Season One of the <strong>TEKKEN 254 Circuit</strong> (now the <strong>Savanna Circuit</strong>) in January 2018.</p>
        <p>TEKKEN 254 became a registered business under the name "TEKKEN Two-Five-Four Gaming" on 15 December 2017. In September 2021, the business was folded and the brand continued to be managed by Ace Pro Sports Technologies until April 2023, when its management was handed over to the community.</p>
