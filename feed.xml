<p>As part of their move list, several characters in <em>Tekken</em> have <strong>parries</strong>, <strong>reversals</strong>, and <strong>sabakis</strong>, which can be powerful defensive options when used correctly, and fatal when misused. However, a vast majority of the <em>Tekken</em> community often lumps all three together under one name, often calling them all parries. All three counter attacks from the opponent, so what's the difference between them?</p>

<section>
    <h2 class="site-red">Parries</h2>
    <p>A parry is a move that counters the opponent's attack and <strong>does nothing more on its own</strong>. The reward for a successful parry varies between characters, for example:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="/guides/character.html?view=lei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lei Wulong</a> has parries that give him frame advantage</li>
        <li><a href="/guides/character.html?view=master-raven" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Master Raven</a> has parries that allow her to create distance with the opponent</li>
        <li><a href="/guides/character.html?view=jin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Jin Kazama</a> has a parry that affords him a wide range of manual follow-ups, depending on the parried move's recovery</li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <h2 class="site-red">Reversals</h2>
    <p>A reversal is a move that counters the opponent's attack and <strong>returns another attack</strong>. The attack returned may depend on the nature of the reversed attack (i.e. punch or kick) and, like with parries, the reward for a successful reversal varies between characters, for example:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="/guides/character.html?view=nina" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nina Williams</a> has a reversal that leads to a chain throw</li>
        <li><a href="/guides/character.html?view=heihachi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Heihachi Mishima</a> has a reversal that leads to a floor break, though he still takes damage</li>
        <li><a href="/guides/character.html?view=asuka" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Asuka Kazama</a> has a reversal that leads to a combo at the wall (punches only)</li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <h2 class="site-red">Sabakis</h2>
    <p>A sabaki is an attack that <strong>counters the opponent's attack at certain points of its animation</strong>. Unlike a reversal, a sabaki does not require a successful counter to connect with the opponent, though <strong>its properties change on a successful counter</strong>. Once again, the reward for a successful sabaki counter varies between characters, for example:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="/guides/character.html?view=leo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Leo Kliesen</a> has a sabaki that knocks down the opponent for a guaranteed follow-up</li>
        <li><a href="/guides/character.html?view=feng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Feng Wei</a> has a sabaki that launches the opponent</li>

<section>
    <h2 class="site-red uppercase">Pools</h2>
    <p>On 5 November 2021, Mozambique's Bigdaddymike and South Africa's Callym Beukes engaged in the <a href="https://twitter.com/BNEesports/status/1456667626864840711" target="_blank">Pools Selection process</a> for the Regional Finals as the top two seeded players. The process curiously ended with Callym pitting Bigdaddymike against all three Kenyans in Pool A, while at the same time having to face both his fellow South Africans DaXpt and Drooopy-ZA, as well as Zambia's Onyx, in Pool B.</p>
    <p>The Regional Finals began with Frost taking a convincing 2-0 win over Xstar, while DVK stumbled to a narrow 2-1 loss against Bigdaddymike. Frost then faced Bigdaddymike and produced one of the rounds of the tournament with an impressive comeback playing Negan against Bryan, but ultimately suffered the same fate as DVK by succumbing to a 2-1 defeat.</p>

    <p>Pool A continued with DVK clinching a 2-0 win over Xstar, effectively knocking him out of the tournament. Therefore, the following set between DVK and Frost would decide who advances to the final stage and was expected to be close given their history, but DVK pulled out a rather dominant performance to win 2-0 and bundle Frost out of the tournament in the process. The surprises didn't end there though, as Xstar pulled off the upset of the tournament by coming back from 1-0 down to beat Bigdaddymike 2-1 in a very close set.</p>

    <p>Xstar's win would prove crucial in deciding the outcome of Pool A; with both DVK and Bigdaddymike now tied at 2-1 in Pool A, the former advanced to the final stage in first place with a points difference of 3 (2-0, 2-0, 1-2), while the latter finished second with a points difference of 1 (2-1, 2-1, 1-2).</p>

    <h2 class="site-red uppercase">Final Stage</h2>
    <p>The final stage began with DVK squaring up against Callym Beukes in a runback from the Losers' Final at the Online Masters. DVK caught everyone off guard by starting off the set with Geese, but didn't look at the races with the character and switched back to Miguel after losing the match 3-1. Callym won a further two rounds in Match 2 before DVK's controller suddenly disconnected, forcing him to forfeit the third round (and therefore the entire match) in line with the <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/legal/community-events/official-rules-toc2021" target="_blank">TOC rules</a> on match interruptions.</p>
    <p>Now with a mountain to climb, DVK defiantly began mounting a comeback in Match 3. Recovering from a trade in Round 4 in which Callym got a tailspin but failed to follow up on with a combo, DVK managed to close out a 3-1 win off a nail-biting slo-mo moment.</p>

    <p>Callym came close to winning the set in Match 4 after winning two rounds, but DVK once again turned it up a gear to complete a reverse sweep and set up a final match. It was here that DVK seemed to run out of gas, with Callym employing a much more aggressive game to win three rounds straight and send DVK to the Losers' Final.</p>
    <p>An in-form Bigdaddymike was DVK's next opponent, and things were looking rough in the beginning. DVK found himself in a tough spot at 2-0 down after losing six straight rounds, with Bigdaddymike seemingly finding an answer for everything thrown his way. It was in Match 3 that DVK finally offered some steely resistance, coming back from one round down to win two and come very close to getting his first match win on the board, only for Bigdaddymike to come up with another one of the fiery comebacks he had been pulling off all tournament.</p>
    <p>With DVK just one hit away from victory and up against the wall, Bigdaddymike approached with Bryan's hatchet kick (qcb+3), then sidestepped DVK's retaliatory down jab and followed up with a decisive whiff punish. DVK's run came to an end as Bigdaddymike took the final round to set up a rerun of the Online Masters grand final against Callym. Interestingly, DVK was eliminated by the same opponents from the Online Masters, by the same scorelines, but in reverse order (at the Online Masters, DVK lost 3-0 to Bigdaddymike in the Winners' Final, then 3-2 to Callym in the Losers' Final).</p>

<p>The Regional Finals are set to take place on 6 November 2021, with competitors fighting for their share of the overall US$ 6,000 prize pool.

The two players' results leave them in fourth and fifth place in the regional leaderboard respectively, and with no further events scheduled at the time of writing, also likely guarantee them spots in the Regional Finals scheduled for 6 November 2021.

    <h2 class="site-red uppercase">Pools</h2>
    <h3 class="site-green uppercase">Pool 1</h3>
    <p>The tournament began in the pool stage with a total of seven Kenyans taking part. In Pool 1, Xstar kicked off his run with a 2-1 win over Malagasy player Sokas, before being sent down to the losers' bracket early by South African player CactuarKiDD. Elsewhere in the bracket, <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=4644523" target="_blank">Frost</a> looked to be headed for Top 8 after getting consecutive 2-0 wins against Malagasy players Tikalo and Mijoro, as well as CactuarKiDD. However, in the Winners' Final, Frost was sent to the losers' bracket on a coin toss, having agreed to the procedure along with his opponent&mdash;eventual South African runner-up Callym Beukes&mdash;rather than facing each other on what they deemed an unfavourable Internet connection.</p> 
    <p>Down in the losers' bracket, Xstar seemed intent on making up as much ground as he could, clinching consecutive 2-0 wins against South African players SuperSora and Streetwise_Damage, as well as Malagasy player Yondaime, before getting his revenge on CactuarKiDD with a 2-1 win. In an all-Kenyan Losers' Final, Xstar managed to upset Frost in a 2-0 win that saw him sail through into Top 8.</p>
    <h3 class="site-green uppercase">Pool 2</h3>
    <p>In Pool 2, <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=3798058" target="_blank">Furious Monkey</a> started off with a 2-0 win over South African player Jon-snoo, before getting a walkover over Zambian player Kamui who was disqualified for failing to appear in the tournament. However, he was then sent to the losers' bracket in a 2-0 loss to South African player Drooopy-ZA, who eventually finished the tournament in fourth place, before being sent home by fellow South African player Gasmaskguy in another 2-0 loss.</p>
    <p>Elsewhere in Pool 2, <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=0749083" target="_blank">Darktempest</a> began his run with a 2-0 win over Malagasy player Kami, before being handed a walkover over South African player Jin, who was also disqualified as a no-show. Drooopy-ZA would also prove to be Darktempest's gatekeeper in the bracket, consigning him to a 2-0 loss to send him the losers' bracket, after which Malagasy player TOavn handed him a 2-1 loss to send him out of the tournament.</p>
    <h3 class="site-green uppercase">Pool 3</h3>
    <p>In Pool 3, <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=7167649" target="_blank">Vega</a> was the first Kenyan to step into action, clinching a 2-0 win over South African player Carly_GGs. Waiting for him in the next round, however, was none other than DVK, who won 2-0 to send him to the losers' bracket. Vega managed to stay alive with a walkover win over South African no-show ShinGouki, a 2-0 win over another South African, MrChocolatezzz, and then another walkover win over Angolan player Eddy Wang who also failed to appear for the tournament, prior to being bundled out by Malagasy player Manounou.</p>
    <p>Following his win over Vega, DVK was handed a walkover over yet another no-show, Malagasy player Kotolita, prior to securing back-to-back 2-0 wins over South African player Genoss Hazard and Malagasy player MOMOSIS to secure himself a spot in Top 8.</p>
    <h3 class="site-green uppercase">Pool 4</h3>
    <p>Pool 4 saw perhaps the biggest controversy of the tournament as far as the Kenyan contingent is concerned. Reigning Savanna Circuit champion <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=2907096" target="_blank">Mickey</a> conceded a walkover in his first set against Malagasy player Cerberus261 for excessive delays, prior to getting a 2-1 win over South African player 404.</p>
    <p>In his second set of the losers' bracket, despite having reported a 2-0 win over Malagasy player ChickenLord, Mickey was controversially disqualified again for excessive delays, having earlier reported that his game had crashed during the set. It is worth noting that the <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/legal/community-events/official-rules-toc2021" target="_blank">TOC rules</a> state that "if a Match disruption occurs that is out of control of the Players of the Match Set, such as action of another Player’s un-desynced controller or a Game software crash or console hardware failure making Players unable to continue a Match, the Tournament Organizer staff member shall order the Players to restart the Match."</p>

    <p>Over in the Winners' Side of Top 8, DVK continued his run with a 2-0 win over Drooopy-ZA to proceed to the Winners' Final. Opting to use <a href="/guides/character.html?view=miguel" target="_blank">Miguel</a> against his opponent's <a href="/guides/character.html?view=hwoarang" target="_blank">Hwoarang</a>, DVK put on a convincing display to book a showdown with the eventual champion, Mozambique's Bigdaddymike. It was here that DVK was finally sent to the losers' bracket, succumbing to a strong display from Bigdaddymike's <a href="/guides/character.html?view=bryan">Bryan</a>; switching to <a href="/guides/character.html?view=jin">Jin</a> from Miguel after losing the first match, DVK was unable to find any significant answers and suffered a 3-0 loss.</p>
    <p>In the losers' bracket, Xstar carried on his winning streak against South African Kunimitsu player Unga Bunga. Undoubtedly the most exciting moment of the set was how Xstar ended it, catching Unga Bunga with <a href="/guides/character.html?view=king">King</a>'s infamous Rolling Death Cradle to send him crashing out of the tournament.</p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

    </div>
    <p>It was in the Losers' Quarter-Finals, however, that Xstar's run would come to an end, becoming the third Kenyan victim of none other than Drooopy-ZA, who went with <a href="/guides/character.html?view=feng">Feng</a> to face Xstar's King. Drooopy-ZA employed some elusive gameplay that Xstar couldn't seem to catch on to for the most part, sailing through to the Losers' Semi-Final with a 2-0 win. Xstar's run earned him 70 points to leave him in fifth place in the TOC South Africa regional league leaderboard, as well as US$ 60 in prize money.</p>
    <p>In the Losers' Final, DVK returned to Miguel to face off against Callym Beukes, an <a href="/guides/character.html?view=eddy">Eddy</a> loyalist who had earlier knocked out his compatriot Drooopy-ZA with a 2-0 win in the Losers' Semi-Final. It was a frantic set that saw the two players going back and forth; DVK employed some aggressive play to take the first match but seemingly took his foot off the gas in the second, allowing Callym to dictate proceedings and level the score. DVK resumed the aggression to take the set to 2-1, but struggled to get in as Callym put on a solid defensive performance to take the set to a final match. DVK could not regain momentum and continued to work very hard to impose himself on Callym, but the South African's defence ultimately proved decisive as he sent DVK home to earn a Winners' Semi-Final rematch with Bigdaddymike in the Grand Final.</p>
    <p>DVK's run earned him 150 points to leave him in fourth place in the TOC South Africa regional league leaderboard, as well as US$ 260 in prize money.</p>

As the co-founder of <a href="https://www.naiccon.co.ke/">NAICCON</a> (Nairobi Comic Convention), Barasa was a figurehead of geek culture in Kenya and at the core of the convention’s continued growth since its inception in 2014.</p>

<p>Barasa was also head of business at <a href="https://www.psg.co.ke/">Pro Series Gaming</a>, with whom we collaborated on the <a href="/news/2018/07/16/kenya-vs-south-africa">Kenya vs South Africa team battle</a> in July 2018, the Nairobi vs Durban team battle in December 2018, and the Finals for <a href="/circuit/archive/tekken/season-3.html">Season 3</a> of the <a href="/circuit">TEKKEN 254 Circuit</a> in August 2019.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Kenyan fighting game community, Savanna FGC extends its heartfelt condolences to Barasa’s family, friends, and colleagues at both NAICCON and Pro Series Gaming. As a key member of the esports fraternity in Kenya, he will be sorely missed.</p>]]></content><author><name>[&quot;tekken254&quot;]</name></author><category term="statements" /><category term="Brian Barasa" /><category term="Naiccon" /><category term="Pro Series Gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The NAICCON and Pro Series Gaming co-founder met his sudden demise this past weekend.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tekken 7 Armour Moves</title><link href="https://tekken254.co.ke/news/2021/07/15/armour-moves" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tekken 7 Armour Moves" /><published>2021-07-15T03:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2021-07-15T03:00:00+03:00</updated><id>https://tekken254.co.ke/news/2021/07/15/armour-moves</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tekken254.co.ke/news/2021/07/15/armour-moves"><![CDATA[<p>This list of armour moves (power crushes) is based on version 4.20 of <em>Tekken 7</em>.

<p>The second season of the TOC will include 14 regions across the globe, with African countries set to participate for the first time; “West Africa” and “South Africa” are the listed regions for the continent, with Kenya listed in the latter alongside Uganda, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, Angola, Mozambique, Madagascar, Comoros, Seychelles, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Réunion and Malawi.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="/news/2020/04/13/circuit-suspended">suspension of the TEKKEN 254 Circuit</a> (now the Savanna Circuit) in March 2020, players within the Kenyan community have continued to compete online on <a href="/fight-night">Savanna Fight Night</a> (which continues on 11 June 2021) alongside other local competitions. The second season of the Tekken Online Challenge presents the Kenyan community its first opportunity to get involved in official global Tekken competition since <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=0749083">Darktempest</a> and <a href="/circuit/tekken/profile.html?id=2907096">Mickey</a> took part in the 2019 season of the Tekken World Tour, competing at Cape Town Showdown in South Africa and Rox n Roll Dubai in the United Arab Emirates respectively.</p>
