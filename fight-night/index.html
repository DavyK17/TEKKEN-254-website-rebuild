    <p>The second competition on TEKKEN 254's portfolio, <strong>Savanna Fight Night</strong> (SFN) is a lineal championship series introduced to maintain a competitive spirit within and foster rivalries amongst players in the community. The series is also
        a replacement for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLywPefEOxPcOAtwYUDAgWtOO1RrRoj5kT" target="_blank">Hall of Pain (HoP)</a>, which remained largely inactive since its inception in 2018. All SFN fight cards are streamed every
        second and fourth Friday of the month on our
        <a href=" https://twitch.tv/tekken254" target="_blank">Twitch</a> and
        <a href="https://youtube.com/tekken254-main" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channels from 7 to 9 pm East African Time.
    </p>
    <p>The series uses a lineal ranking system akin to those used in combat sports such as boxing, with only the top 5 ranked players eligible to fight on a main event. Each SFN fight card consists of 3 undercard fights (FT3) and the main event (FT5). Registration for SFN is completely free and open to EAC residents of all skill levels aged 13 and
        above.</p>
    <p>Players may issue challenges to other players at any rank. Challenges are placed on a backlog known as the <strong>Pending List</strong>, which is used to schedule fight cards on upcoming editions of SFN. Priority is given to players who did not appear
        in the previous edition (players with the least recent appearances given more priority).
