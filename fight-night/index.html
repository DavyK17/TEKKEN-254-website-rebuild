    <p>The second competition on TEKKEN 254's portfolio, <strong>Savanna Fight Night</strong> (SFN) is a lineal championship series introduced to maintain a competitive spirit within and foster rivalries amongst players in the community. The series is also
        a replacement for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLywPefEOxPcOAtwYUDAgWtOO1RrRoj5kT" target="_blank">Hall of Pain (HoP)</a>, which remained largely inactive since its inception in 2018. All SFN fight cards are streamed every
        second and fourth Friday and Saturday of the month on our
        <a href=" https://twitch.tv/tekken254" target="_blank">Twitch</a> and
        <a href="https://youtube.com/tekken254-main" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channels from 7 to 9 pm East African Time.
    </p>
    <p>The series uses a lineal ranking system akin to those used in combat sports such as boxing, with only the top 5 ranked players eligible to fight on a main event. Each SFN fight card consists of 3 undercard fights (FT3) and the main event (FT5).</p>
    <p>Players may issue challenges to other players at any rank, with community voting ultimately deciding which challenges will feature on a SFN fight card. Registration for SFN is completely free and open to EAC residents of all skill levels aged 13 and
        above.</p>
    <!-- <p>Players may issue challenges to other players at any rank, with community voting ultimately deciding which challenges will feature on a SFN fight card.
                However, players may not appear on two consecutive fight cards (i.e. Friday then Saturday,
                or Saturday then Friday on the next SFN weekend).
