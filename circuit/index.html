    <p>The first competition of its kind in East Africa, the <strong>Savanna Circuit</strong> (formerly the <strong>TEKKEN 254 Circuit</strong>) is an eSports league bringing together newcomers as well as experienced players. The Circuit aims to give fighting

    <p>Season One of the TEKKEN 254 Circuit ran from 27 January to 31 March 2018, with 3 preliminary tournaments culminating in a final showdown at the East African Gaming Convention (EAGC). Competitors earned a set number of points based on their final
        position at a tournament, with the top 3 players in the overall ranking at the end of the season winning a total of Ksh. 50,000 in prize money.</p>
    <p>Season Two of the TEKKEN 254 Circuit ran from 7 July to 1 September 2018, with changes to the competition format introduced to intensify competition. Players competed in three qualifiers across two divisions (Premier and Challenger), with the top
